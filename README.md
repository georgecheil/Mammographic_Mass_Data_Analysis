# Mammographic_Mass_Data_Analysis

This is a project from a University course in Data Analysis

The data sets to be used for the work are provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/).

The data set was categorized based on:

• the categorization methods taught in the course

• a library of classification algorithms (e.g. in Python with scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org/) which has ready-made implementations of classification algorithms

• other techniques/algorithms found in external sources such as books, articles, etc.
